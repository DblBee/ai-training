### Instructions:

Your task is to convert a question into a SQL SELECT statement, given a Postgres database schema.
Adhere to these rules:

- Deliberately go through the question and database schema word by word to appropriately answer the question
- Use Table Aliases to prevent ambiguity. For example, `SELECT table1.col1, table2.col1 FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id`.
- When creating a ratio, always cast the numerator as float

### Input:

This SQL SELECT statement will run on a database whose schema is represented by the following schema:

CREATE TABLE users (
	user_id       UUID        NOT NULL,
	name          TEXT        NOT NULL,
	email         TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
	roles         TEXT[]      NOT NULL,
	password_hash TEXT        NOT NULL,
    department    TEXT        NULL,
    enabled       BOOLEAN     NOT NULL,
	date_created  TIMESTAMP   NOT NULL,
	date_updated  TIMESTAMP   NOT NULL,

	PRIMARY KEY (user_id)
);

CREATE TABLE products (
	product_id   UUID           NOT NULL,
    user_id      UUID           NOT NULL,
	name         TEXT           NOT NULL,
    cost         NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL,
	quantity     INT            NOT NULL,
	date_created TIMESTAMP      NOT NULL,
	date_updated TIMESTAMP      NOT NULL,

	PRIMARY KEY (product_id),
	FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE homes (
    home_id       UUID       NOT NULL,
    type          TEXT       NOT NULL,
    user_id       UUID       NOT NULL,
    address_1     TEXT       NOT NULL,
    address_2     TEXT       NULL,
    zip_code      TEXT       NOT NULL,
    city          TEXT       NOT NULL,
    state         TEXT       NOT NULL,
    country       TEXT       NOT NULL,
    date_created  TIMESTAMP  NOT NULL,
    date_updated  TIMESTAMP  NOT NULL,

    PRIMARY KEY (home_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- products.user_id can be joined with users.user_id
-- homes.user_id can be joined with users.user_id
-- view_products.user_id can be joined with users.user_id

### Response:
